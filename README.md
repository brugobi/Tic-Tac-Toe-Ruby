 - About the game

*Tic-tac-toe* is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the
 spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
 vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. The following example game is won by the first player, X:

Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a *draw*. Hence, tic-tac-toe is 
most often played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
Because of the simplicity of *tic-tac-toe*, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the
concepts of good sportsmanship or to write a computer program to play it. (WIKIPEDIA. Article:

 - About this project

The aim of this exercise is to learn about the Object Oriented Programming by using *classes*, *Instances*, *Modules* and relationships between objects.
